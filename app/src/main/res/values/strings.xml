    <string name="sample_desc">NGC 2359 is a helmet-shaped cosmic cloud with wing-like appendages popularly called Thor\'s Helmet. Heroically sized even for a Norse god, Thor\'s Helmet is about 30 light-years across. In fact, the helmet is more like an interstellar bubble, blown as a fast wind from the bright, massive star near the bubble\'s center inflates a region within the surrounding molecular cloud. Known as a Wolf-Rayet star, the central star is an extremely hot giant thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova stage of evolution. NGC 2359 is located about 15,000 light-years away in the constellation Canis Major. The remarkably detailed image is a mixed cocktail of data from broadband and narrowband filters that captures natural looking stars and the glow of the nebula\'s filamentary structures. It highlights a blue-green color from strong emission due to oxygen atoms in the glowing gas.</string>
